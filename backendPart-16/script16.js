// Reference
// Definition: A reference refers to the memory address of a value rather than the value itself. When you reference an array, you are essentially pointing to its location in memory.

// Embedding
// Definition: Embedding involves creating a physical copy of the data and storing it. Each embedded copy is independent, meaning changes to one copy do not affect others. The advantages of embedding is data can be read faster but it will take additional space.
